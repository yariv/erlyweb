<h3><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h3>

<p>ErlyWeb is a component-oriented web development framework that
simplifies the creation of web applications in Erlang according to
the tried-and-true MVC pattern. ErlyWeb's goal is to let web developers
enjoy all the benefits of Erlang/OTP while
creating web applications with simplicity, productivity and
fun.</p>

<p>ErlyWeb is designed to work with Yaws, a
high-performance Erlang web server. For more information on Yaws, visit
<a href="http://yaws.hyber.org" target="_top"><tt>http://yaws.hyber.org</tt></a>.</p>


<h3><a name="Directory_Structure">Directory Structure</a></h3><p>
ErlyWeb applications have the following directory structure:</p>

<pre>[AppName]/
  src/                            contains non-component source files
    [AppName]_app_controller.erl  the app controller
    [AppName]_app_view.rt         the app view
  components/                     contains controller, view and
                                  model source files
  www/                            contains static assets
  ebin/                           contains compiled .beam files</pre>

<p>where AppName is the name of the application. The 'src', 'components'
and 'www' directories may contain additional subdirectories, whose contents
are of the same type as those in the parent directory.</p>

<h3><a name="Components">Components</a></h3>

<p>An ErlyWeb component is made of a controller and a view, both of which are
Erlang modules. Controllers
may use one or more models, but this isn't required.</p>

<p>(Technically, a component can be implemented without a view, but
most components have views.)</p>

<p>Controllers are implemented in Erlang source files. Views are typically
implemented in ErlTL files,
but views can be implemented in plain Erlang as well.
The controller file is named '[ComponentName]_controller.erl' and the view
file is named '[ComponentName]_view.[Extension]', where [ComponentName] is
the name of the component, and [Extension] is 'erl' for Erlang files and
'et' for ErlTL files.</p>

<p>When ErlyWeb receives a request such as <code>http://hostname.com/foo/bar/1/2/3</code>,
ErlyWeb interprets it as follows: 'foo' is the component name, 'bar' is the
function name, and <code>["1", "2", "3"]</code> are the parameters (note that
parameters from browser requests are always strings).</p>

<p>When only the component's name is present, ErlyWeb assumes the request is
for the component's 'index' function and with no parameters (i.e.
<code>http://hostname.com/foo</code> is equivalent to <code>http://hostname.com/foo/index</code>).</p>

<p>If the module 'foo_controller' exists and it exports the function
'bar/4', ErlyWeb invokes the function foo_controller:bar/4
with the parameters <code>[A, "1", "2", "3"]</code>, where A is the Arg record
that Yaws passes into the appmod's out/1 function. (For more information,
visit <a href="http://yaws.hyber.org/" target="_top"><tt>http://yaws.hyber.org/</tt></a>.)</p>

<h3><a name="Models">Models</a></h3>

<p>ErlyWeb treats all Erlang modules whose names don't end with '_controller'
or '_view' and whose files exist under 'src/components' as models.
If such modules exist, erlyweb:compile()
passes their names to erlydb:code_gen()
in order to generate their ErlyDB database abstraction functions.</p>

<p>If your application uses ErlyDB for database abstraction, you
have to call erlydb:start() before erlyweb:compile() (otherwise,
the call to erlydb_codegen() will fail).
If you aren't using ErlyDB, don't keep any
models in 'src/components' and then you won't have to call erlydb:start().</p>

<h3><a name="Controllers">Controllers</a></h3>

<p>Controllers contain most of your application's logic. They are the glue
between Yaws and your applications models and views.</p>

<p>Controller functions always accept the Yaws Arg as the first parameter, and
they may return any of the values that Yaws appmods may return (please read
the paragraph below concerning returning standard Yaws tuples to avoid
running into trouble). In addition, they may return a few special values,
which are listed below with their meanings
(note: 'ewr' stands for 'ErlyWeb redirect' and 'ewc' stands for 'ErlyWeb
Component.').</p>

<p><code>ewr</code><br>
Redirect the browser to the application's root url.</p>

<p><code>{ewr, ComponentName}</code><br>
Redirect the browser to the component's default ('index')
function</p>

<p><code>{ewr, ComponentName, FuncName}</code><br>
Redirect the browser to the URL for the given component/function combination.</p>

<p><code>{ewr, ComponentName, FuncName, Params}</code><br>
Redirect the browser to the URL with
the given component/function/parameters combination.</p>

<p><code>{data, Data}</code><br>
Call the view function, passing into it the Data variable as a parameter.</p>

<p><code>{ewc, A}</code><br>
Analyze the Yaws Arg record 'A'. If the request matches a component,
render the component and send the result to the browser.
Otherwise, return <code>{page, Path}</code>, where Path is the Arg's appmoddata field.</p>

<p><code>{ewc, ComponentName, Params}</code><br>
Render the component's 'index' function with the given parameters
and send the result to the view function.</p>

<p><code>{ewc, ComponentName, FuncName, Params}</code><br>
Render the component's function with the given parameters, and send
the result to the view function.</p>

<p><code>{ewc, ControllerModule, ViewModule, FuncName, Params}</code><br>
This tuple lets you specify exacly which controller and
view modules ErlyWeb uses to render the sub-component. You should only use
it if you need very fine-grained control over the rendering
sub-components. This tuple is considered for advanced use only.</p>

<p>Controller functions may also return (nested) lists of
'ewc' and 'data' tuples, telling ErlyWeb to render the items
in their order of appearance and then send the list of their results to
the view function.
This feature lets you build components that are composed of a mix of
dynamic data and one or more sub-components.</p>

<p>If a component is only supposed to exist as a subcomponent, you can
implement the function "<code>private() -&gt; true.</code>" in its controller to
prevent web clients from accessing the component by requesting
its corresponding URL.</p>

<p>If a controller function doesn't have a corresponding view function,
ErlyWeb calls the controller function, processes the result (if necessary),
and then sends the output back to Yaws. When you wish to bypass the
view layer and return a standard Yaws tuple such as {html, ...} or
{ehtml, ..}, you should avoid defining a view function. Otherwise,
Yaws may fail to understand the response and crash the process.</p>

<h3><a name="Containers">Containers</a></h3><p>
Containers are ErlyWeb components in which other components can
be nested. ErlyWeb contains no special logic to enable containers;
'container' is just a word used to describe a component the application code
uses in a special way.</p>

<p>The application code passes container controller functions
<code>ewc</code> and/or <code>data</code> tuples representing nested components. The controller
functions include those tuples in their return values,
telling ErlyWeb to render the
nested components and include the results in the parameters of the
container's corresponding view functions.
The view functions nest the rendered subcomponents in the
container's surrounding content, and the result is sent back to Yaws.</p>

<p>Let's take a look at an example.
Below is the code for a simple HTML container. It accepts any
<code>ewc</code> or <code>data</code> tuple (or list thereof), renders it, and embeds the result
in a basic HTML page.</p>

html_container_controller.erl:
<pre>-module(html_container_controller).
-export([index/2, private/0]).

%% tells ErlyWeb to reject direct HTTP requests for this
%% container
private() -&gt;
  true.

index(_A, Ewc) -&gt;
  Ewc.</pre>

html_container_view.et:
<pre>&lt;%@ index(Data) %&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;My ErlyWeb App&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;% Data %&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>

<p>Below is the code for a component that called 'song' that nests the title
of a song in html_container.</p>

<p>data in html_container:</p>

song_controller.erl:
<pre>index(A) -&gt;
  {ewc, html_container, [A, {data, "Back in the USSR"}]}.</pre>

song_view.et:
<pre>&lt;%@ index(Data) %&gt;
&lt;% Data %&gt;</pre>

<h3><a name="The_App_Controller">The App Controller</a></h3>

<p>All ErlyWeb applications have a module called [AppName]_app_controller,
whose source file is in the 'src' directory by convention. This module
has a single function by default, whose basic implementation is</p>

<p><code>hook(A) -&gt; {ewc, A}.</code></p>

<p>This implementation tells ErlyWeb to invoke the component associated with
the request's URL and send the result back to Yaws.</p>

<p>You can change the implentation of hook/1 to rewrite the Arg,
add headers, implement authentication logic, or perform any other
action upon receiving a browser request at the application level.</p>

<p>The app controller has a special feature to facilitate the nesting of
rendered content inside containers (prior to ErlyWeb v0.5, similar,
but more limited, functionality was provided by app views, which have since
been removed). In addition to returning <code>ewc</code> and/or Yaws tuples, hook/1
can return a tuple of the form <code>{phased, Ewc, Fun}</code>. This tuple tells ErlyWeb
to process the request in 2 phases: first, render the initial component,
and then embed any resulting iolists in another component.</p>

<p><code>Ewc</code> can be any <code>ewc</code>
tuple, but it's usually just <code>{ewc, A}</code>. <code>Fun</code> is a function of the form
<code>fun(ExpandedEwc, Data) -&gt; FinalEwc end</code>, where <code>ExpandedEwc</code> is the result of
calling <a href="erlyweb.html#get_initial_ewc-1"><code>erlyweb:get_initial_ewc/1</code></a> with <code>Ewc</code> as the parameter, and
<code>Data</code> is any rendered data obtained from processing the original <code>Ewc</code>.
<code>FinalEwc</code> is another <code>ewc</code> and/or <code>data</code> tuple telling ErlyWeb what to do
with the rendered <code>Data</code>.</p>


<h4><a name="App_Controller_Compilation_Hooks">App Controller Compilation Hooks</a></h4>

<p>App controllers may implement two additional functions that ErlyWeb
uses: before_compile/1 and after_compile/1. These functions let you
hook into the compilation process and extend it in arbitrary ways.
Both functions take a single parameter indicating the last compilation
time (as returned from calendar:local_time()), or 'undefined' if the
last compilation time is unknown.</p>

<h3><a name="Views">Views</a></h3>

<p>Views are Erlang modules whose functions return iolists (nested lists
of strings and/or binaries). A view function that ErlyWeb uses has
the same name as its corresponding controller function,
and it accepts a single parameter, which is the result of ErlyWeb's
processing of the controller function's return value.</p>

<p>Views may implement the special function render/1. If this function exists,
ErlyWeb passes into it the results of other functions in the
same view module and then returns the result of render/1 back to Yaws.
This feature simplifies creating view elements,
such as headers and footers, that are common to all component functions.</p>

<p>In ErlTL files, the render/1 function is always at the top of the file,
and its parameter is named 'Data'. When you implement a view
as an ErlTL template, even if your view functions don't share any common
elements, you should at least have the following line at the top of the file
(under the top-level forms tag, if it exists):</p>

<p><code>&lt;% Data %&gt;</code></p>

<p>This line tells ErlTL to not dismiss the values that ErlyWeb passes into
render/1. Without this line,
ErlyWeb would return an empty response back to Yaws.
(The reason is that ErlTL would compile the view's render/1 function as
"<code>render(Data) -&gt; [].</code>" instead of "<code>render(Data) -&gt; [Data].</code>".)</p>

<h3><a name="The_App_View">The App View</a></h3>

<p>ErlyWeb applications normally have a view module called
[AppName]_app_view, whose source file is in the 'src' directory.
Before returning to Yaws a rendered iolist, ErlyWeb checks
if this module exists and if it exports the function render/1.
If it does, ErlyWeb passes the iolist to render/1 and then
returns the result back to Yaws.</p>

<p>This feature allows you to easily create global view elements, such as headers
and footers, for your application.</p>

<h3><a name="Advanced_Controller_Topics">Advanced Controller Topics</a></h3>

<p>Note: The contents of this section are considered experimental
and are subject to future changes.</p>

<h4><a name="Advanced_Response_Values">Advanced Response Values</a></h4><p>
Sometimes, you may need to extend ErlyWeb's basic behavior
and exercise a greater degree of control over how your
components are rendered and what values ErlyWeb returns to Yaws after it
renders certain components. This may include setting HTTP headers or
choosing a different app view for specific components or
component functions.</p>

<p>Starting from ErlyWeb v0.4 (currently in svn trunk),
controllers can return a tuple of the type
<code>{response, Elems}</code>, where Elems is a list of tuples telling ErlyWeb
what special actions to take when handling the response.
These are the values you can add to the Elems list:</p>

<p><code>{app_view, ModuleName}</code><br>
This tells ErlyWeb to use a different app view for rendering the
final output. ModuleName may have 2 special values: 'default' tells ErlyWeb
to use the default app view, and 'undefined' tells ErlyWeb to not
use any app view (this is often useful for AJAX responses).<br>
This tuple applies only to top-level components; ErlyWeb ignores it
in subcomponents.</p>

<p><code>{app_view_param, Ewc}</code><br>
Normally, the app view's render/1 function accepts as its parameter an
opaque iolist. However, sometimes you may wish to pass specific values
to render/1 in order to parameterize it based on the logic in
controller functions. When Elems contains the <code>{app_view_param, Ewc}</code>
tuple, ErlyWeb renders the Ewc value (an <code>{ewc,..}</code> or <code>{data,...}</code> tuple,
or a list thereof) and then
passes into the app view's render/1 function a 2 element list: the first
element is the rendered Ewc, and the second element is the normal opaque
iolist.<br>
This tuple applies only to top-level components; ErlyWeb ignores it
in subcomponents.</p>

<p>For example, if the following were your controller function,</p>

<pre>index(A) -&gt;
  {response, [{app_view_param, {data, &lt;&lt;"Hello"&gt;&gt;}},
  {body, {data, "from ErlyWeb"}}]}.</pre>
view function
<pre>&lt;%@ index(Data) %&gt;
&lt;% Data %&gt;!</pre>
and app view template,
<pre>&lt;? [A, B] = Data %&gt;
&lt; A %&gt; &lt;% B %&gt;</pre>

<p>then the final result would be an iolist containing the message
"Hello from ErlyWeb!"</p>

<p><code>{view_param, Ewc}</code><br>
Similar to app_view_param, but affects the parameter passed into the
component view's render/1 function.</p>

<p><code>{body, Ewc}</code><br>
Ewc is the normal value that the function would return without the
'response' tuple. ErlyWeb processes it and then sends the result to the
corresponding view function (if one exists).
Note: this value must appear after all of the tuples above (for performance
reasons).</p>

<p>In addition to these values, Elems may include any value that
Yaws accepts, such as <code>{header, Header}</code>, <code>{html, Html}</code>, etc. ErlyWeb
returns these values, as well as the rendered component,
in their order of appearance.</p>

<h4><a name="The_`before_return'_Hook">The `before_return' Hook</a></h4><p>
ErlyWeb provides a hook for changing the responses from all functions in
a controller before ErlyWeb processes them. This lets you avoid
repetition in your code in scenarios such as
when you wish to disable the app view, add a given subcomponent, or
set HTTP headers for an entire controller. To use this hook, you may
implement the function before_return/3 in your controllers. Its first
parameter is the name of the function,
its second parameter is the list of parameters passed to the function,
and the third parameter is the function's original return value. It returns
the modified response.</p>

<p>For example, to disable the app view for all the functions in a controller
except 'index', you could implement before_return/3 as follows:</p>

<pre>before_return(index, _Params, Response) -&gt; Response;
before_return(_FuncName, _Params, {response, Elems}) -&gt;
  {response, [{app_view, undefined} | Elems]};
before_return(_FuncName, _Params, Body) -&gt;
  {response, [{app_view, undefined}, {body, Body}]}.</pre>


<h3><a name="Yaws_Configuration">Yaws Configuration</a></h3>
To use ErlyWeb, you need to configure Yaws to use the erlyweb module
as an appmod (for more information, visit <a href="http://yaws.hyber.org" target="_top"><tt>http://yaws.hyber.org</tt></a>)
for your application. You can do this by adding the the following lines
to your yaws.conf file:
<pre>docroot = /path/to/app/www
appmods = &lt;[UrlPrefix], erlyweb&gt;
&lt;opaque&gt;
  appname = [AppName]
&lt;/opaque&gt;</pre><p>
where AppName is the name of your application and 
UrlPrefix is the URL prefix that Yaws uses to identify requests for this
application (common values are '/[AppName]', for deploying multiple
applications on the same server, or '/', for deploying a single application).</p>

Note: It is recommended to use ErlyWeb with Yaws v1.66 and above.</body>
