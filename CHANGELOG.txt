v0.4.2

- erlyweb:compile() now obey relative include paths passed as {i, Path} options. It treats the base directory as [AppDir]/src. Absolute paths also work now.

- Fixed the SELECT statement generation for self-referencing many-to-many relations when find_related_many_to_many() includes a custom Where clause (this is a fix in erlsql.erl, which didn't add enough parens around the conditions).

- Removed the if_saved() checks in erlydb_base.erl for the following functions: find_related_many_to_many(), aggregate_related_many_to_many(), find_related_many_to_one(), aggregate_related_many_to_one(), and delete(). This means these functions no longer call exit({no_such_record, Rec}) if is_new(Rec) returns true.

- Changed the return value of erlydb_base:delete/1 to return the number of rows deleted. Previously, if the number of rows deleted was zero or greater than one, this function crashed.

- Related to the last item, erlydb_base:after_delete/1 changed from "after_delete(Rec) -> ok." to "after_delete({Rec, NumDeleted}) -> NumDeleted.".

- Fixed a bug in the accumulation of rendered iolists and other response elements for components having multiple subcomponents.

- Fixed a bug in the auto-compilation feature causing an internal data-structure to grow indefinitely upon automatic recompilations.

- Added the validate/3 function to erlyweb_util.

- Introduced a new return type, 'ewr', to redirect to the application's root url.

- Introduced a new return type, {ewc, ControllerModule, ViewModule, Func, Params} to enable fine-grained control over ErlyWeb's rendering of components.

- Exposed 2 new functions: erlyweb:get_ewc/2 and erlyweb:get_initial_ewc/2. These functions are useful primarily in the app controller for expanding an {ewc, A} tuple to its full representation, i.e. {ewc, ControllerModule, ViewModule, Func, Param}.

- Optimized the generated code for mapping incoming requests and nested components to their controller/view modules.

- Removed the before_return() and module_info() functions from the list of controller functions exposed to incoming requests.

- Made a few small internal optimizations.

- Updated the documentation.

- Removed support for app views and component views' render() function. Their functionality is now attained with containers.

- Added the {phased, Ewc, Fun(ExpandedEwc, Data)} response tuple to the app controller to support conditional containers.

- Refactored the compilation logic to a new file called 'erlyweb_compile.erl'.

- Added the get_cookie/2 function to erlyweb_util.

- Fixed the include paths support for files compiled with ErlyDB.


v0.4.1

- Added compiler debug_info to ebin files.

- Added a make script for Windows.

- Fixed a bug that where ErlyDB was using module names instead of table
  names to construct queries for self-referencing many-to-many relations.

- Fixed a bug preventing an ErlyDB module for defining a single field which
  is also the 'identity' primary key field.

v0.4

- Added support for arbitrary primary key fields. ErlyDB now gets its primary key information from the database and everything 'just works.' Note that foreign key fields now have a more general naming convention: instead of [TableName]_id, they are called [TableName]_[PrimaryKeyField].

- Added support for self-referencing many-to-many relations. A module can now define a many-to-many relation to itself, and ErlyDB would use special database querying logic to handle this case. Relation tables in such scenarios have a different field naming convention. For more information, read the documentation at the top of erlydb.erl (it will be published when v0.4 is released).

- Fix: Database updates in add_related_many_to_many() and remove_related_many_to_many() are now in done in transactions.

- Fix: Foreign key field names and many-to-many relation table names are now derived from a module's database table's name, not the module's name (note: this only affects modules that override the table() function).

- Fix: Proper handling of -include() directives in Smerl (Smerl now automatically searches the source file's directory for header files).

- {ewr, Name} now triggers a redirect to the component with the given name, not the function with the given name in the same component. This is a more logical behavior (and it also matches the documentation :) ).

- Fix: You can now use 'ewr' tuples in {response, Elems}

- erlydb_field:extras/1 now returns 'undefined' instead of 'none'.

- erlydb_field:key/1 now returns 'undefined' instead of 'none'.

- In ErlyDB, functions ending with '_first' (e.g. language:projects_first(Erlang)), which return the first record of a related module, now return either the related record or 'undefined' instead of a list that may be empty or contain the one related record. This is to be consistent with the behavior of Module:find_first().

- Some functions in erlydb_base used to call exit({error, {no_such_record, Rec}}}) if they were passed a record(s) that hadn't been saved in the database. To be consistent with other errors, these functions now call exit({no_such_record, Rec}).

- Fixed a documentation bug referring to 'allow_unsafe_sql' instead of 'allow_unsafe_statements'

- Fixed a bug in where a call to Model:save/1 inside Model:transaction/1 would cause a crash when it results in an UPDATE statement.

- Removed the "Skipping compilation of..." debug statement.

- Made several documentation updates.

- Updated the ErlyDB test code.

- Added the debug_info flag to ErlyWeb app compilation.

- Added a make script and a create app script.

- Added the MySQL driver code as an external repository resource.
