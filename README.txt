ErlyWeb is a web development framework for Erlang. It lets you quickly and easily build database-driven webapps following the MVC pattern.

For more information, visit http://erlyweb.org.


=== Installation instructions ===

In the ErlyWeb directory, execute

./configure
make
sudo make install


This assumes you have yaws installed under your Erlang lib directory (which you can find by calling code:lib_dir() in the Erlang shell).
